# This script automates the database testing workflow.
# It takes a single argument: the name of the SQL file.
# Version 2: Adjusted for comparator.py argument style.

# --- Validation ---
# Check if an argument (the SQL file) is provided.
if [ -z "$1" ]; then

# Check if the provided file exists

# Extract the base filename without the .sql extension.
# For example, from "test_query.sql", this will get "test_query".

# --- Step 1: Generate the .res file ---
# Run the auto.sh script with the provided SQL file.
echo "Running auto.sh for $1..."

# --- Step 2: Compare and create the .diff file ---
# Run the comparator.py script.
# It now takes the base filename as its only argument.
echo "Running comparator.py..."

# --- Step 3: Analyze the .diff and create a summary ---
# Run the analyzer.py script to analyze the .diff file.
# This assumes analyzer.py takes the .diff file as an argument.
echo "Running analyzer.py..."
python3 analyzer.py "${FILENAME}.diff"
